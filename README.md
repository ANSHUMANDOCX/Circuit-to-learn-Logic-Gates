# Circuit-to-learn-Logic-Gates
It is a PCB which helps us learn about gates. We can check the function of each gate in real life with the help of buttons and leds

**We can use any NPN Transistor for this circuit**
**The XNOR gate mentioned in the Schematic is not present isn the PCB due to design issues**
